Aria walked home late after her evening class. The street was quiet, and a cool breeze moved through the trees. As she passed the old bakery, she noticed a small orange cat sitting by the door, staring at her. It didn’t look scared—just curious.
Aria knelt down and held out her hand. To her surprise, the cat walked up confidently and brushed against her fingers.
There was a tiny silver tag on its collar: “Return to Willow Lane, House 14.”
Aria smiled. She knew that lane—it was just a few minutes away.
“Alright, little one,” she whispered, picking up the warm, purring cat. “Let’s get you home.”
